### Providers
### Flow Wallet Provider
Flow wallet Provider is a class that allows interaction with the Flow blockchain network for wallet-related functionalities.

#### Methods
The `sendTransaction` method is used to send a transaction to the Flow blockchain network using Cadence code and arguments. It also takes an optional `authz` parameter for authorization.

The `executeScript` method executes a script on the Flow blockchain network using Cadence code, arguments, and a default value to return.

The `buildAuthorization` method constructs an authorization object for signing transactions with the provided private key and account index.

The `signMessage` method signs a message using the provided private key.

The `syncAccountInfo` method synchronizes the account information of the wallet provider with the Flow blockchain network.

The `getWalletBalance` method retrieves the wallet balance from the cache or synchronizes the account information and returns the balance.

The `queryAccountBalanceInfo` method queries the balance information of the wallet provider's account on the Flow blockchain network.

The `isFlowAddress` function checks if an address is a valid Flow address.

The `isEVMAddress` function checks if an address is a valid EVM address.

The `isCadenceIdentifier` function checks if a string is a valid Cadence identifier.

The `getSignerAddress` function retrieves the signer address from the runtime settings.

The `get` method in the `flowWalletProvider` object injects the Flow wallet provider into the runtime context if the necessary settings are configured and retrieves the wallet balance information for the user.


### Flow Connector Provider
This provider offers functionality related to the Flow connector for AI agents.

#### Methods
The `get()` method is used to retrieve the status of the Flow connector for the current user. It returns a string containing information about the Flow network and endpoint that the user is connected to.

## Usage Examples
### actions/transfer.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. **First use case with code example:**
   - Creating a transfer action for sending tokens to a recipient address.
   ```typescript
   const transferAction = new TransferAction();
   const transferContent: TransferContent = {
       token: 'ETH',
       amount: 10,
       recipient: '0x1234567890ABCDEF',
       match: false
   };
   transferAction.transfer(transferContent);
   ```

2. **Second use case with code example:**
   - Processing incoming messages to execute transfer actions.
   ```typescript
   const transferAction = new TransferAction();
   const messages: any[] = [...]; // Incoming messages to process
   transferAction.processMessages(messages);
   ```

### Best Practices
- **Avoid direct manipulation of transfer content:**
  It is recommended to use the provided `TransferAction` methods for creating and executing transfer actions to ensure proper handling of transfer content.

- **Validate recipient addresses:**
  Before executing a transfer action, make sure to validate the recipient address format to prevent errors in the transfer process.

### providers/connector.provider.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Initialize the FlowConnectorProvider with a runtime object:
```typescript
import { FlowConnectorProvider } from 'providers/connector.provider';

const runtime = new Runtime(); // Example runtime object
const connectorProvider = new FlowConnectorProvider(runtime);
```

2. Fetch the status of the Flow connector:
```typescript
import { FlowConnectorProvider } from 'providers/connector.provider';

const runtime = new Runtime(); // Example runtime object
const connectorProvider = new FlowConnectorProvider(runtime);
const connectorStatus = connectorProvider.getConnectorStatus();
```

### Best Practices
- Ensure to use the constructor to properly initialize the FlowConnectorProvider with a runtime object.
- Use the getConnectorStatus method to easily fetch the status of the Flow connector.

### providers/utils/flow.connector.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Initializing the Flow SDK and executing various operations such as sending transactions, executing scripts, and retrieving account information.
```typescript
import { FlowConnector } from 'providers/utils/flow.connector';

const flowJSON = { /* Flow script JSON object */ };
const network = "mainnet";
const defaultRpcEndpoint = "https://mainnet.onflow.org";

const flowConn = new FlowConnector(flowJSON, network, defaultRpcEndpoint);
flowConn.getAccount("0x1234567890abcdef").then((account) => {
    console.log(account);
});
```

2. Sending a transaction with specified code, arguments, and authorizations.
```typescript
import { FlowConnector } from 'providers/utils/flow.connector';

const flowJSON = { /* Flow script JSON object */ };
const network = "mainnet";
const defaultRpcEndpoint = "https://mainnet.onflow.org";

const flowConn = new FlowConnector(flowJSON, network, defaultRpcEndpoint);
const code = "cadence code here";
const args = { /* arguments object */ };
const mainAuthz = { /* main authorization object */ };
const extraAuthz = [ /* additional authorizations array */ ];

flowConn.sendTransaction(code, args, mainAuthz, extraAuthz).then(() => {
    console.log("Transaction sent successfully");
});
```

### Best Practices
- When using the `FlowConnector` class, ensure to initialize the Flow SDK by calling the necessary methods like `getAccount`, `sendTransaction`, `executeScript`, etc. to avoid errors related to uninitialized SDK.
- Supply valid network type and default RPC endpoint while creating an instance of `FlowConnector` to ensure proper communication with the Flow network.

### providers/wallet.provider.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. FlowWalletProvider can be used to interact with the Flow blockchain network for sending transactions, executing scripts, and managing wallet balances.
```typescript
const walletProvider = new FlowWalletProvider();
walletProvider.network = "mainnet";
walletProvider.sendTransaction({ /* transaction details */ });
walletProvider.executeScript({ /* script details */ });
console.log(walletProvider.getWalletBalance());
```

2. The isFlowAddress function can be used to verify if a given address is a valid Flow address.
```typescript
const address = "f8d6e0586b0a20c7";
if (isFlowAddress(address)) {
    console.log("Valid Flow address");
} else {
    console.log("Invalid Flow address");
}
```

### Best Practices
- Ensure to set the network property of the FlowWalletProvider instance before interacting with the blockchain network.
- Use the syncAccountInfo method to keep the account information updated for accurate balance checks.

### types/index.ts

### Common Use Cases

1. Executing a Cadence script using the provided interfaces:
```typescript
import { IFlowSigner, TransactionResponse, FlowAccountBalanceInfo, IFlowScriptExecutor } from "./types";

const signer: IFlowSigner = {...};
const scriptExecutor: IFlowScriptExecutor = {...};

const code = "pub fun main(): Int { return 42 }";
const args = (arg: any) => [{ type: "String", value: arg }];

// Execute a script with arguments
scriptExecutor.executeScript(code, args("Hello"), 0).then(result => {
    console.log(result);
});

// Execute a transaction
const transactionCode = "transaction() {...}";
const transactionArgs = [{ type: "String", value: "example" }];
const transactionResponse = new TransactionResponse(signer);
transactionResponse.executeTransaction(transactionCode, transactionArgs).then(result => {
    console.log(result);
});

// Get account balance info
const address = "0x123456789";
const balanceInfo = new FlowAccountBalanceInfo(signer);
balanceInfo.getAccountBalance(address).then(result => {
    console.log(result);
});
```

2. Implementing custom scripts using the provided interfaces:
```typescript
import { IFlowScriptExecutor } from "./types";

class MyScriptExecutor implements IFlowScriptExecutor {
    executeScript(code: string, args: fcl.ArgumentFunction, defaultValue: T): Promise<T> {
        // Custom implementation for executing a Cadence script
    }
}

// Create an instance of custom script executor
const myScriptExecutor = new MyScriptExecutor();

// Use custom script executor
myScriptExecutor.executeScript("pub fun main(): String { return \"Custom Script\" }", args("Example"), "").then(result => {
    console.log(result);
});
```

### Best Practices

- Always handle promises returned by executing scripts or transactions to properly capture the results or errors.
- Use TypeScript to ensure type safety and proper usage of interfaces and functions.

### environment.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Validate Flow Blockchain configuration based on runtime settings and environment variables:
```typescript
import { IAgentRuntime } from 'runtimeModule';
import { FlowConfig, validateFlowConfig } from 'environment';

const runtime: IAgentRuntime = // initialize the runtime object
validateFlowConfig(runtime)
  .then((config: FlowConfig) => {
    // Use the validated Flow Blockchain configuration
  })
  .catch((error: Error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

2. Define and use a custom FlowConfig object:
```typescript
import { FlowConfig } from 'environment';

const customFlowConfig: FlowConfig = {
  // Add custom Flow Blockchain configuration properties
  port: 9000,
  nodeURL: 'https://custom-node-url.com'
};

// Use the custom FlowConfig object as needed
```

### Best Practices
- When using the `validateFlowConfig` function, ensure that you have set up the `IAgentRuntime` object correctly to provide the necessary runtime settings.
- When defining a custom FlowConfig object, make sure to include all required properties as per the schema to avoid errors during validation.

### queries.ts

- Use Case 1: Querying the balance of an EVM ERC20 token
```typescript
import { queryEvmERC20BalanceOf } from './queries';

const executor = new FlowScriptExecutor();
const owner = '0x1234567890abcdef';
const evmContractAddress = '0xa1b2c3d4e5f6';

queryEvmERC20BalanceOf(executor, owner, evmContractAddress)
    .then(balance => {
        console.log(`Balance of ${owner}: ${balance}`);
    })
    .catch(err => {
        console.error('Error querying balance:', err);
    });
```

- Use Case 2: Querying account balance info
```typescript
import { queryAccountBalanceInfo } from './queries';

const executor = new FlowScriptExecutor();
const owner = '0x1234567890abcdef';
const evmContractAddress = '0xa1b2c3d4e5f6';

queryAccountBalanceInfo(executor, owner, evmContractAddress)
    .then(balanceInfo => {
        console.log('Account balance info:', balanceInfo);
    })
    .catch(err => {
        console.error('Error querying account balance info:', err);
    });
```

- Best Practice 1: Always provide appropriate error handling when using these query functions to handle any potential exceptions that may occur.
- Best Practice 2: Make sure to instantiate a `FlowScriptExecutor` object before calling any of the query functions to ensure proper execution.
