## Features

### Actions
### CREATE_TOKEN
Create a new meme token on PickPump platform (Internet Computer). This action helps users create and launch tokens specifically on the PickPump platform.

#### Properties
- Name: CREATE_TOKEN
- Similes: CREATE_PICKPUMP_TOKEN, MINT_PICKPUMP, PICKPUMP_TOKEN, PP_TOKEN, PICKPUMP发币, PP发币, 在PICKPUMP上发币, PICKPUMP代币

#### Handler
The handler for this action creates a new meme token on the PickPump platform. It generates a token logo, uploads it to Web3Storage, and then creates the token transaction using the provided name, symbol, description, and logo.

#### Examples
- User 1: "I want to create a space cat token on PickPump"
  User 2: "Creating space cat token on PickPump..."
  User 2: "✨ Token created successfully!"

- User 1: "Help me create a pizza-themed funny token on PP"
  User 2: "Creating pizza token on PickPump..."



### Providers
### WalletProvider
The WalletProvider class is responsible for managing ICP identity, creating HTTP agent, and creating actor instances to interact with Internet Computer canisters.

#### Methods
The `createAgent` method creates and returns an HTTP agent for the given identity and host.

The `getIdentity` method returns the Ed25519KeyIdentity associated with the WalletProvider instance.

The `getPrincipal` method returns the Principal associated with the identity of the WalletProvider instance.

The `createActor` method asynchronously creates an actor instance with the given interface factory, canister ID, and optional flag to fetch the root key.

The `icpWalletProvider` function is a utility function that retrieves the private key from the runtime settings, creates a WalletProvider instance with the private key, and returns the wallet information along with its identity and principal. If an error occurs, it returns an error message instead.

The `createAnonymousActor` utility function creates an actor instance anonymously using the given interface factory, canister ID, host, and an optional flag to fetch the root key.



### Evaluators
