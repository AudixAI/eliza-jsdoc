const registerAction = new RegisterIPAction(walletProvider);
const params = {
  ip: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 8080,
  protocol: 'http'
};
const runtime = {}; // Add actual runtime object
registerAction.registerIP(params, runtime).then(response => {
  console.log(response);
}).catch(err => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

2. Creating multiple instances of RegisterIPAction with different wallet providers.

```typescript
import { RegisterIPAction } from './actions/registerIP';

const walletProvider1 = new WalletProvider('provider1');
const walletProvider2 = new WalletProvider('provider2');

const registerAction1 = new RegisterIPAction(walletProvider1);
const registerAction2 = new RegisterIPAction(walletProvider2);

// Use registerAction1 and registerAction2 separately for different IP asset registrations
```

```typescript
import { WalletProvider } from './providers/wallet';

const walletProvider = new WalletProvider(runtime);
walletProvider.connect().then(privateKey => {
    console.log(`Connected to wallet provider with private key: ${privateKey}`);
});
```

2. Getting the wallet balance of the connected wallet provider:
```typescript
import { WalletProvider } from './providers/wallet';

const walletProvider = new WalletProvider(runtime);
walletProvider.getWalletBalance().then(balance => {
    console.log(`Wallet balance: ${balance}`);
});
```

### Best Practices
- Ensure proper error handling for Promise rejections in asynchronous methods.
- Use the getAddress method to retrieve the address of the wallet provider before performing any transactions or operations.

import { IPMetadata } from './types/api';

const metadata: IPMetadata = {
    title: 'Sample IP',
    description: 'This is a sample intellectual property.',
    author: 'John Doe'
};

console.log(metadata.title); // Output: Sample IP
```

2. Defining a RoyaltyHolder object:
```typescript
import { RoyaltyHolder } from './types/api';

const holder: RoyaltyHolder = {
    id: '12345',
    ownership: 'full'
};

console.log(holder.id); // Output: 12345
```

### Best Practices
- Always ensure that you are consistent with the properties and types defined in the interfaces.
- Use the provided interfaces to maintain a consistent data structure throughout your codebase.

### types/index.ts

### Common Use Cases

```typescript
const transaction: Transaction = {
    hash: '0xabc123',
    from: '0x123456',
    to: '0x789abc',
    value: BigInt(100),
    data: '0xabcdef',
    chainId: 1
};
```

2. Representing a token with balance information:
```typescript
const tokenWithBalance: TokenWithBalance = {
    token: {symbol: 'ABC', decimals: 18, address: '0xdef789', name: 'TokenABC', chainId: 1},
    balance: BigInt(500),
    formattedBalance: '500.00',
    priceUSD: '100.00',
    valueUSD: '50000.00'
};
```
