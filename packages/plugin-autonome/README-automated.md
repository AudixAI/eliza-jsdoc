# @elizaos/plugin-autonome Documentation

## Overview
### Purpose
The @elizaos/plugin-autonome is designed to extend the capabilities of autonomous agents by integrating them with dynamic contexts and real-time information. This allows agents to perform complex tasks that require interaction with external systems, offering enriched responses beyond simple message transactions.

### Key Features
Provides dynamic contextual information through Providers,Facilitates integration with external systems using Actions,Enables assessment and information extraction using Evaluators,Supports configuration management with the LaunchAgentContent interface,Validity check for configuration via isLaunchAgentContent function

## Installation
## Installation and Integration Instructions for @elizaos/plugin-autonome

### 1. Adding the plugin to your ElizaOS project:

- Add the following to your agent/package.json dependencies:
  ```json
  {
    "dependencies": {
      "@elizaos/plugin-autonome": "workspace:*"
    }
  }
  ```

- Navigate to the agent/ directory in your project.
- Run `pnpm install` to install the new dependency.
- Run `pnpm build` to build the project with the new plugin.

### 2. Importing and using the plugin:

- Import the plugin using: `import { autonomePlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-autonome";`
- Add `autonomePlugin` to the `AgentRuntime` plugins array in your code.

### 3. Integration example showing the complete setup:

```typescript
import { autonomePlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-autonome";

return new AgentRuntime({
    // other configuration...
    plugins: [
        autonomePlugin,
        // other plugins...
    ],
});
```

### 4. Verification steps:

Ensure successful integration by checking for ["âœ“ Registering action: <plugin actions>"] in the console after running your ElizaOS project.

Remember to also manage the plugin's dependencies and peer dependencies as listed above to avoid any potential issues during installation and integration.

## Configuration
# Configuration Documentation

## Required Environment Variables

1. `AUTONOME_JWT_TOKEN`: Used to store the JWT token for the Autonome service.
2. `AUTONOME_RPC`: Used to store the RPC endpoint for the Autonome service.

## .env Example File

```shell
AUTONOME_JWT_TOKEN=your_jwt_token_here
AUTONOME_RPC=your_rpc_endpoint_here
```

Please configure the required environment variables in the .env file. Ensure that the .env file is added to the .gitignore to prevent it from being committed to the repository.

## Features

### Actions
### LAUNCH_AGENT
Launch an Eliza agent

#### Properties
- Name: LAUNCH_AGENT
- Similes: CREATE_AGENT, DEPLOY_AGENT, DEPLOY_ELIZA, DEPLOY_BOT

#### Handler
The handler for LAUNCH_AGENT action launches an Eliza agent by sending a request to a specified RPC endpoint with the necessary configuration details. It then logs the success message or any errors encountered during the process.

#### Examples
- User: "Launch an agent, name is xiaohuo"
- Agent: "I'll launch the agent now..."
- Agent: "Successfully launch agent, id is ba2e8369-e256-4a0d-9f90-9c64e306dc9f"



### Providers
No providers documentation available.

### Evaluators
No evaluators documentation available.

## Usage Examples
### actions/launchAgent.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Checking if a provided content is a valid LaunchAgentContent:
```typescript
const content = {
  name: "Agent1",
  config: "Config1"
};

if(isLaunchAgentContent(content)){
  console.log("Valid launch agent content");
} else {
  console.log("Invalid launch agent content");
}
```

2. Using the LaunchAgentContent interface to create a new launch agent:
```typescript
const newAgent: LaunchAgentContent = {
  name: "Agent2",
  config: "Config2"
};

console.log("New Launch Agent:", newAgent);
```

### Best Practices
- Use the LaunchAgentContent interface to ensure consistency in the structure of launch agent content.
- Document the launch agent creation process to easily reference the expected format of the launch agent content.

## FAQ
### Q: My action is registered, but the agent is not calling it
Ensure that action's name clearly aligns with the task, and ensure you give a detailed description of the conditions that should trigger the action

### Q: Can the plugin integrate with my CRM system?
Yes, by implementing a Provider module that bridges between the agent and your CRM, you can supply real-time contextual information to the agent.

### Q: How do I determine if the content is a valid LaunchAgentContent?
You can utilize the isLaunchAgentContent function which returns true for valid content and false otherwise.

### Q: How can I extend the agent's evaluation capabilities?
You can extend the evaluation capabilities by integrating custom Evaluator modules that support additional data extraction and memory functions.

### Q: What are the key components I need to define in an Action?
Each Action requires a unique name, an array of similes, a detailed description of its purpose, a validation function, a handler for executing the action, and examples of its usage.

### Q: How do I troubleshoot when my agent's responses lack context?
Ensure your Provider modules are correctly supplying contextual information. Check their integration with external systems and validate the format of the information being injected.

## Development

### TODO Items
No TODO items found.

## Troubleshooting Guide
### Agent does not respond with updated real-time data
- Cause: Provider module not properly integrated or failed to fetch data
- Solution: Verify provider configuration and check external data source accessibility

### Launch agent does not start with the intended configuration
- Cause: Invalid LaunchAgentContent being used
- Solution: Use the isLaunchAgentContent function to validate configuration prior to deployment

### Debugging Tips
- Use console logging within Providers and Actions to trace data flow
- Ensure all modules are correctly registered and loaded during initialization
- Review integration documentation for proper setup of external system interfaces
