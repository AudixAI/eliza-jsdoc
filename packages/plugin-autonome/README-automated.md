# @elizaos/plugin-autonome Documentation

## Overview
### Purpose
The @elizaos/plugin-autonome package is designed to enhance the interactive capabilities of agent systems by acting as a middleware between agents and diverse sets of external data sources and services. It provides a robust infrastructure to facilitate real-time data injections, behavior modifications, task execution beyond simple query responses, and deep conversational assessments. This makes it an essential tool for developing intelligent and responsive agent applications.

### Key Features
Dynamic context injection via Providers,Flexible action execution with customizable Action modules,Comprehensive conversational analysis with Evaluators,Seamless integration with AgentRuntime systems,Support for diverse external system interactions,Enhanced agent memory and goal tracking capabilities

## Installation
# Installation and Integration Instructions for @elizaos/plugin-autonome

## Adding the Plugin to Your ElizaOS Project

1. Add the following to your agent/package.json dependencies:
   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "@elizaos/plugin-autonome": "workspace:*"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Navigate into the agent/ directory.

3. Run `pnpm install` to install the new dependency.

4. Run `pnpm build` to build the project with the new plugin.

## Importing and Using the Plugin

1. Import the plugin using:
   ```typescript
   import { autonomePlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-autonome";
   ```

2. Add `autonomePlugin` to the AgentRuntime plugins array in your setup.

## Integration Example

```typescript
import { autonomePlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-autonome";

return new AgentRuntime({
    // other configuration...
    plugins: [
        autonomePlugin,
        // other plugins...
    ],
});
```

## Verification Steps

Ensure successful integration by verifying in the console that ["✓ Registering action: <plugin actions>"] is displayed.

*Note: This plugin is a workspace package that needs to be added to agent/package.json and then built.*

## Configuration
# Configuration Documentation

## Required Environment Variables

1. `DATABASE_URL`: Specifies the URL for connecting to the database.
   - Example: `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/dbname`

2. `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key used for cryptographic operations.
   - Example: `SECRET_KEY=mysecretkey`

3. `API_KEY`: API key for accessing external services.
   - Example: `API_KEY=api_key_here`

## .env Example File

```plaintext
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/dbname
SECRET_KEY=mysecretkey
API_KEY=api_key_here
```

Please note that the configuration settings should be done in the `.env` file. It is important to ensure that the `.env` file is added to the `.gitignore` file so that sensitive information is not committed to the repository.

## Usage Examples


## FAQ
### Q: Can the Action module trigger multiple tasks simultaneously?
Yes, the Action module can be configured to handle multiple tasks by defining various handlers for each task. Actions have unique identifiers, which allows different tasks to be differentiated and processed as needed.

### Q: Does the Provider module support access to external APIs?
Absolutely. Providers are specifically designed to interact with external systems, including APIs, to fetch dynamic contextual information. They act as a bridge, allowing the agent to access real-time data efficiently.

### Q: How can I extend the Evaluator module to assess new types of data?
You can extend the Evaluator module by providing custom evaluation functions that integrate with the AgentRuntime’s evaluation system. This allows the creation of unique data assessments tailored to specific application needs.

### Q: How do I establish the connection between the Agent and an external data source?
To connect an agent to an external data source, you need to configure a Provider that can interact with the specific data source. Define the necessary access parameters and use the Provider to supply dynamic information to the agent.

### Q: My action is registered, but the agent is not calling it
Ensure that the action's name clearly aligns with the task, and ensure you give a detailed description of the conditions that should trigger the action. Check action registration and invocation logic for potential issues.

### Q: What are common examples of Actions in this system?
Actions can range from querying an external weather API for current conditions to initiating tasks like sending emails or adjusting thermostat settings in a smart home. Example actions are often illustrated in code as part of the system documentation.

## Development

### TODO Items
No TODO items found.

## Troubleshooting Guide
### Providers are not delivering expected data
- Cause: Incorrect configuration or connectivity issues with external services
- Solution: Verify that all API keys and access details are correctly configured. Check network connectivity and ensure external services are online and accessible.

### Action handlers are not executing as expected
- Cause: Faulty logic within the handler implementation or incompatible handler parameters
- Solution: Review the handler function for syntax errors or logical flaws. Validate parameter compatibility and ensure proper handler registration.

### Debugging Tips
- Enable detailed logging to track calls and data exchanges between modules.
- Use mock data and test cases to simulate external system interaction and evaluate behavior.
- Ensure each module has well-defined error handling to capture and log unexpected issues.
