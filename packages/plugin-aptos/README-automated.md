## Features

### Actions
### SEND_TOKEN
Transfer tokens from the agent's wallet to another address

#### Properties
- Name: SEND_TOKEN
- Similes: ["TRANSFER_TOKEN", "TRANSFER_TOKENS", "SEND_TOKENS", "SEND_APT", "PAY"]

#### Handler
The handler for the SEND_TOKEN action transfers tokens from the agent's wallet to another address. It validates the transfer content, composes the transfer context, generates transfer content, and sends the tokens using the Aptos blockchain.

#### Examples
- User: "Send 69 APT tokens to 0x4f2e63be8e7fe287836e29cde6f3d5cbc96eefd0c0e3f3747668faa2ae7324b0"
- Agent: "I'll send 69 APT tokens now..."
- Agent: "Successfully sent 69 APT tokens to 0x4f2e63be8e7fe287836e29cde6f3d5cbc96eefd0c0e3f3747668faa2ae7324b0, Transaction: 0x39a8c432d9bdad993a33cc1faf2e9b58fb7dd940c0425f1d6db3997e4b4b05c0"



### Providers
### WalletProvider
The WalletProvider class provides methods to fetch and manage wallet data.

#### Methods
The `fetchPortfolioValue()` method is used to fetch the portfolio value of a wallet based on the specified address. It retrieves the APT prices and the APT amount held by the account to calculate the total USD value and total APT value of the portfolio.

The `fetchPrices()` method is responsible for fetching the current prices of APT from an external API. It retries the fetch operation with backoff logic in case of failure and caches the retrieved prices for future use.

The `formatPortfolio()` method takes the runtime and portfolio data as input and formats the portfolio information into a string. It includes the character name, wallet address, total USD value, and total APT value in a human-readable format.

The `getFormattedPortfolio()` method is a wrapper that invokes `fetchPortfolioValue()` to retrieve the portfolio data and then formats it using `formatPortfolio()`. It catches any errors that occur during the process and returns an error message if needed.



### Evaluators
No evaluators documentation available.

## Usage Examples
### providers/wallet.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. Creating an instance of WalletProvider and fetching prices for a wallet:
```typescript
import { WalletProvider } from './providers/wallet';

const aptosClient = new Aptos();
const walletAddress = '0xabcdef123456789';
const cacheManager = new ICacheManager();

const walletProvider = new WalletProvider(aptosClient, walletAddress, cacheManager);
walletProvider.fetchPrices().then((prices) => {
    console.log(prices); // Prices fetched successfully
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error(error); // Error fetching prices
});
```

2. Reading and writing data to cache using the WalletProvider instance:
```typescript
// Assume walletProvider is initialized as in the previous example

const dataToCache = { key: 'value' };
const cacheKey = 'cachedData';

walletProvider.writeToCache(cacheKey, dataToCache).then(() => {
    walletProvider.readFromCache(cacheKey).then((cachedData) => {
        console.log(cachedData); // { key: 'value' } - Data read from cache
    }).catch((error) => {
        console.error(error); // Error reading from cache
    });
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error(error); // Error writing to cache
});
```

### Best Practices
- Ensure to handle errors properly when calling asynchronous methods to avoid unhandled promises.
- Use consistent cache keys and data structures for easy retrieval and storage of cached data.

### actions/transfer.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. **Transfer funds to a recipient**: 
```typescript
import { TransferContent, isTransferContent } from './actions/transfer';

const transferData: TransferContent = {
  recipient: 'John Doe',
  amount: 100
};

if (isTransferContent(transferData)) {
  // Process the transfer
} else {
  console.log('Invalid transfer content');
}
```

2. **Validate transfer content**: 
```typescript
import { TransferContent, isTransferContent } from './actions/transfer';

const invalidTransferData = {
  recipient: 'Jane Smith',
  amount: '200 dollars'
};

if (isTransferContent(invalidTransferData)) {
  // Process the transfer
} else {
  console.log('Invalid transfer content');
}
```

### Best Practices
- **Validate input data**: It is a good practice to use the `isTransferContent` function to validate the transfer content before processing it to ensure data integrity.
- **Type checking**: Ensure that the `recipient` is of type string and the `amount` is of type string or number as specified in the `TransferContent` interface. This prevents unexpected errors during the transfer process.

### enviroment.ts

### Common Use Cases
1. **Create and validate Aptos configuration:**
This code can be used to create and validate an Aptos configuration by retrieving required settings from the runtime and environment variables. For example, if you have an agent runtime environment set up and want to validate the Aptos configuration, you can use the `validateAptosConfig` function with the runtime environment as a parameter.

```typescript
const runtime: IAgentRuntime = {
  // Define properties of the agent runtime environment
};

validateAptosConfig(runtime)
  .then((config: AptosConfig) => {
    // Use the validated Aptos configuration
  })
  .catch((error: Error) => {
    // Handle any validation errors
  });
```

2. **Access Aptos configuration settings:**
Once the Aptos configuration is validated, you can access the settings defined in the configuration for various purposes. For example, if you need to access a specific setting from the Aptos configuration, you can retrieve it from the validated configuration object.

```typescript
validateAptosConfig(runtime)
  .then((config: AptosConfig) => {
    const settingValue = config.settingName;
    // Do something with the setting value
  })
  .catch((error: Error) => {
    // Handle any validation errors
  });
```

### Best Practices
- **Error Handling:** It is recommended to handle any potential errors thrown during the validation process to ensure the reliability of the configuration.
- **Modularization:** Consider modularizing the code that interacts with the validated Aptos configuration to keep it organized and maintainable.

### Q: Can the WalletProvider fetch and cache wallet data in real-time?
Yes, the WalletProvider class is designed to fetch and cache wallet data, ensuring that information is up-to-date and accessed efficiently during interactions.

### Q: How do I validate my Aptos configuration settings?
You can validate your Aptos configuration by using the validateAptosConfig function, which checks the runtime environment settings. It returns a promise that resolves with the validated configuration or throws an error if validation fails.

### Q: How can I extend the plugin to support additional currencies?
To support additional currencies, you can extend the existing interfaces and functions to include new currency properties and update the logic that fetches and processes price data accordingly.

### Q: My action is registered, but the agent is not calling it.
Ensure that the action's name clearly aligns with the task, and provide a detailed description of the conditions that should trigger the action. Verify that your runtime environment is correctly set up to recognize the action.
